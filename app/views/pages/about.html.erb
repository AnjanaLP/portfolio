        <p>As an experienced former Marketing professional working within Telecommunications and Systems Integration,
        the highlight of my job had always been collaborating with software development teams to ensure front-end
        and back-end scripts incorporated all marketing requirements with the highest level of accuracy, efficiency
        and integrity. However, the ability to actually write the code that executed my ideas had always been one of
        my greatest desires.</p>

        <p>Enrolling in an intensive programming course at Makerâ€™s Academy in London provided the perfect
        opportunity to fulfil this longstanding aspiration. I've been coding ever since then, harnessing my skills and further
        advancing my aptitude for software development.</p>
